# WeatherReporting and Chat Application
Designed a application that periodically sends weather updates to the users. Used openweather API and PubNub API. PubNub API is used to create a channel that allows user to subscribe a channel and use that channel for communication purpose. The application also allows user to send messages over that comman channel.
